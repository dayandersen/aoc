This is a basic AOC project. I have written a base runner that will use a cookie from your local .env to pull the day's input if it doesn't exist then save it as a file.
If it exists locally, i.e. has been saved already, it will reuse that file.

You run a given day with `DAY=3 YEAR=2015 make run` or similar
